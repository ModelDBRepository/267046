            This is the simulation code that Calvin and Redish used in their 2021 model. Data from those simulations are available at
            <a href="https://osf.io/79uhy/">https://osf.io/79uhy/</a>.
            If there are any issues or questions about  the code then please let Olivia Calvin know by emailing her at ocalvin@umn.edu or 
            David Redish at redish@umn.edu.

            Simulations should be run by using the 4 laboratories in the root of the folder. They are currently set to just display the
            functioning and do not collect data but can be set to record using the boolean variable collectData. When collectData is True the
            simulations can, and should, be run via command line because you can pass parameters and the desired output location. When
            collecting data, it is recommended that you set the shwTrials variable to False so that it does not create a new set of plots
            with each trial.

            Please note that the behavior saved to the 'dpx.csv' file is not what was presented in the manuscript. Our behavior model was not
            sophisticated enough and our solution required some measures that could only be created after the fact. To recreate the decision
            process utilize the functions in 
            <code>./DPXAnalysis2021/tunecurve.py</code>
            and 
            <code>./DPXAnalysis2021/dpx.py</code>
            to create tuning curves of neural
            activity and to recreate the reaction times from those curves, respectively.
